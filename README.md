# atwork

A script to check if it is currently a working day

Increasingly automated emails are sent by systems for staff at work. Email intrusiveness in staff leave time is an increasing problem interrupting work / life balance. This script is intended for use along side cron jobs to prevent emails being sent on what should be a holiday.
